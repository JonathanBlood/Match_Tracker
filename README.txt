Spectators at amateur sport events often lose track of the score and events on the pitch.
Match Tracker allows users to record matches and view this information at a later date with
features such as leaderboards, previous matches and player information.
The following sports are currently supported:
* Football
* Gaelic
* Hurling 
* Rugby
This application was developed for my Final Year Project.
I hope you like the app,
