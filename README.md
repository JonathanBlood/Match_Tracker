#Match Tracker
> Spectators at amateur sport events often loose track of the score and events on the pitch.

The aim of this project was to develop a smartphone application (Android) which allows users to track match events in a particular sport and publish these results to a website. 

The application is available from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jonathanbloodmatchtracker&hl=en).

**Note:** Google Play version and Github code has the web features stripped out.
